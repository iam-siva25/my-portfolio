                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>A client's existing system was slow, difficult to maintain, and lacked key features required for their growing business. The outdated technology was hindering their productivity and user growth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>My Role and Solution</h3>
                <p>I was tasked with modernizing the system from the ground up. I began with a thorough audit to identify bottlenecks and user pain points. I then developed a new system architecture and migrated the old data, ensuring a smooth transition with no downtime.</p>
                <p>The new system was built with a modern, scalable stack, including **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. I implemented a modular design that made it easy to add new features and a responsive interface that improved usability on all devices.</p>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>The Results</h3>
                <p>The new system delivered a **40% increase in performance**, a **30% reduction in server costs**, and a more flexible platform for future development. The client reported significant improvements in team efficiency and user satisfaction.</p>
